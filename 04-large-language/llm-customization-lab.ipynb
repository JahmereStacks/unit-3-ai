      "2. Hands shoulder-width apart: Keep your hands shoulder-width apart as you jump. This will make it easier to straighten your legs as you step out.\n",

      "4. Keep your core engaged: Keep your core engaged as you jump. This will help you absorb the impact of your landing and prevent your legs from fracturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Initiate your jump: As you bring your legs forward, initiate your jump by lifting your heels off the ground. This will help you land on your heels and prevent your hips from dropping.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Release your arms: Release your arms as you land. This will help you maintain your balance and prevent your hands from flying out.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Control your stride: Be sure to maintain a controlled stride throughout your long jump. This will help you stay balanced and prevent your legs from fracturing.\n",
      "\n",
